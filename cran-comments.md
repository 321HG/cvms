## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.0  
* win-builder

## R CMD check results  
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.  

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies, as it is a new package.

## Resubmission notes
I have fixed the Description and added dontrun to multiple examples, 
and shortened the examples as well, in case dontrun doesn't work.
R CMD Check does not complain about long examples anymore.
