## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1  
* ubuntu 16.04.6 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.3, 3.6.1 and devel
* win-builder

## R CMD check results  
For win-builder, the following packages were not available: 'tidyr', 'ggplot2', 'caret', 'broom', 'stringr', 'knitr'. 
This seems to be a problem with win-builder, not cvms.

Otherwise, there were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies.
